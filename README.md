# Java CLI To-Do Application Challenge

Welcome to the **Java CLI To-Do Application Challenge**! This project invites you to build a command-line interface (CLI) application in Java that helps users manage their tasks effectively. Your mission is to implement a fully functional To-Do application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks—all from the command line.

## Overview

This challenge invites you to build a CLI-based To-Do application in Java, designed to enhance your understanding of essential frontend development challenges. Through this project, you'll explore key concepts such as UI re-rendering, data binding, and state management. By tackling these challenges, you will gain valuable insights into the intricacies of real-world frontend development

## Challenge Objectives

Your challenge is to implement the following features in your CLI To-Do application:

- **Add Tasks**: Allow users to create new tasks with titles and descriptions.
- **View Tasks**: Display a list of all tasks along with their completion status.
- **Update Tasks**: Enable users to modify existing tasks, including marking them as completed.
- **Delete Tasks**: Provide functionality to remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Ensure tasks are saved to a file so they remain available across sessions.

## Challenges

Building the Java CLI To-Do application will come with several challenges that you will need to address:

1. **Data Persistence**: 
   - Maintaining the state of tasks across application sessions is crucial. You'll need to implement file handling techniques to save tasks to a file and load them back when the application starts. This includes managing serialization and deserialization of task objects.

2. **UI Rendering**:
   - Although the application runs in a command-line interface, you still need to create a user-friendly experience. You'll face challenges in rendering the text output in a clear and organized manner. Designing a clean menu structure and ensuring consistent formatting will be essential for usability.

3. **Data Binding**:
   - Ensuring that the data entered by users is correctly bound to the task model will require careful validation. You'll need to implement checks to ensure that user inputs meet expected formats and handle exceptions where necessary.

4. **Task Management Logic**:
   - Implementing the logic for adding, updating, viewing, and deleting tasks involves creating robust methods that manage the underlying data structure. You'll need to consider how to efficiently update the task list and ensure data integrity.

5. **User Interaction**:
   - As a command-line application, handling user input effectively will be key. You'll need to ensure that your application can gracefully handle incorrect inputs, providing helpful feedback to guide users in navigating the application.

## Requirements

To successfully complete this challenge, you should have:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher.
- A basic understanding of Java and command-line operations.
- Familiarity with file handling in Java is a plus!

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-cli-todo-app.git
    cd java-cli-todo-app
    ```

2. **Compile the Application**:
    ```bash
    javac -d bin src/index.java src/models/*.java src/database/*.java src/pages/*.java src/utils/*.java
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    java -cp bin index
    ```

## Project Structure

Here’s the project structure you'll be working with:

```
├── database
│   └── TodoList.java       # Handles data storage and retrieval for tasks
├── index.java              # Entry point of the application
├── models
│   └── Task.java           # Represents the Task model with properties
├── pages
│   ├── Home.java           # Displays the home menu and options
│   ├── Page.java           # Base class for page handling
│   └── Welcome.java        # Welcomes the user to the application
├── README.md               # Documentation for the project
└── utils
    └── Utils.java          # Utility functions for the application
```

## Usage

Once you run the application, you'll be welcomed with a menu of options. Use the following commands to interact with the To-Do application:

- **`add`**: Add a new task.
- **`view`**: View all tasks.
- **`update`**: Update an existing task.
- **`delete`**: Delete a task.
- **`exit`**: Exit the application.

Follow the prompts for each command to complete the challenge and manage your tasks efficiently!

## Contributing
